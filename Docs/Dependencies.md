# Deterministic Dependency Restore

## Committed dependency files

These files are the source of truth for reproducible builds. **Commit them and do not exclude from version control.**

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Packages/manifest.json` | Declares direct UPM dependencies and (optionally) scoped registries. Unity resolves versions from here. |
| `Packages/packages-lock.json` | Lock file: exact resolved versions of all packages (direct + transitive). Ensures everyone gets the same dependency tree. |
| `ProjectSettings/` | All project and player settings (Unity version, Android/Quest config, quality, etc.). Required to open and build the project. |

After cloning, open the project in Unity once so that the package manager restores from `manifest.json` and `packages-lock.json`. No extra restore step is needed if both files are present.

## Third-party content under Assets/

Audit of content under `Assets/` that might be considered “plugins” or SDKs:

| Location | Contents | Recommendation |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| `Assets/Plugins/Android/` | `AndroidManifest.xml` (Quest/MR overrides) | **Keep in Assets/** — small, project-specific. Commit. |
| `Assets/Oculus/` | `OculusProjectConfig.asset`, project setup | **Keep in Assets/** — project config from Meta XR; not a standalone plugin. |
| `Assets/MetaXR/` | Provider profiles (Hugging Face, DETR), model assets | **Keep in Assets/** — project-specific config and assets; not a reusable UPM package. |
| `Assets/XR/` | OpenXR/XR settings assets | **Keep in Assets/** — project settings; packages provide the runtime, these are overrides. |
| `Assets/Resources/` | OVRBuildConfig, OculusRuntimeSettings | **Keep in Assets/** — generated/config from Meta XR SDK. |
| `Assets/CompositionLayers/` | Composition layer runtime settings | **Keep in Assets/** — project-specific. |

**Conclusion:** No third-party SDKs under `Assets/` are currently suitable for converting to local UPM packages (`Packages/com.<name>/`). All are either small, project-specific, or generated by existing UPM packages (e.g. Meta XR SDK). If you add a large third-party plugin later, consider (a) keeping in `Assets/` if small, (b) converting to a local package under `Packages/com.<vendor>.<name>/` with `package.json` and asmdefs, or (c) adding a git URL or scoped registry entry in `manifest.json`.
